In this project I would be gaining the information from the QR code / Barcode from the food items and assigning them a score to them
throught the formula or 


the food ingredients would also be shown 
and if any ingredients causes any infection should be specified to look out for and alerting

i had installed the neccessary libraries that are to be used :
        -> pyzbazar
        -> panda (numpy " main" and some other too that AI recomended )
        -> openCV
        -> pre installed Tinker

12/02/2025
i had learned about openCV and 
        -> created a frame to read using the front-cam of the windows
        -> i also did the uploading part how to upload the image file to 
        -> i also added the exit button 
all working fine  

14/02/2025
I created CLI version of the code that i want to evaluate the follwoing 
        -> uploading the image from the libraries of the operating system
        -> scanning the image from the system
all working fine
        
16/02/2025
        -> i made changes to the CLI and GUI version considering the working of each
I decoded the QR/ Barcode using pyzbar and the number generated is to 
be used to get the neccessary information


Currently fine working But ,



20/02/2025
        -> I install the request library to retrive the information from the openfoodfact or any other sites to get the  required information
        -> Major issue i got ,the other API planning to use was dropped as it charge payment to use the service 
        -> I am currently planning to move on with Open Food Fact .org only 
Still Facing the issue for many products unable to scan



25/02/2025
I had the basic testing done for the application at the development stage for CLI only. here's what I kown
        -> The clarity of image should be there otherwise the scanner won't detect the barcode and the frame should have the barcode focus
        -> The picture upload should have the same, barcode focus and clear image and etc
        -> Mainly It identify product on Open Food Fact only so products not present in the open food fact would return a error and i don't have any other api to used
If I have to specify the eficency of the current stage would be about 10% as i don't get the information of all the product and if it's feasible i could send the barcode number to the ChatGPT and get the info and then analyze it 


28/02/2025
I got how to evaluate the packet information on two basis 
        ->Nutrient Profiling 
                where i take the fat and sugar present in with respect to 10g  assign them nutrious ,less nutrious and highly nutrious
        ->ingredient Profiling
                where i just assigned some predefined terms for organic and chemical get them in the respecitve list organic and chemical if any other information present will be in others list


02/03/2025
I created the Exe file for the CLI version of the application and Tested with my predefined test Case and here's what i got
        -> I need a good foramtting to show the information
        -> It shows the result i wanted in test case still
I also jumped to GuI which I think has better foramtting then CLI version
